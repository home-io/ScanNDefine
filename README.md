ScanNDefine
===========

Android Barcode scanning application written using Android-Studio (I/O Preview) v.0.2.1.0. 
This app allows you scan items, view where the scanned items data came from, and soon I will add ability to add
to a shopping list. This project demonstrates several basics in Android programming such as Relative, Frame,
and List views. Also if you want to learn about using external libraries or native C libraries prepared for an 
Android App this project encompases those techniques. More info to come as this project is finished/updated.

Code Comment is limited at this time.  Code will be fully commented upon completion for the benefit of new developers
just begining their Android Development journey!
